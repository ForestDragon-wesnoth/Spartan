NOTE: this is no longer updated for now, as changes are now on Github

Here's today's demo version of the demo (with a revolutionary mechanic: allies. They're summoned by most of the new upgrade, AI-controlled, and are targeted by the enemies' ranged attacks too. This should noticeably make the addon feel different from the original game):

Beta 3 Changelog:
-the add-on now shows up/works in ACTUAL multiplayer (but as a mp scenario
for now, since I don't yet know how to make it show up as a mp campaign)
-the depth 35 archmage rematch has been reworked (now the archmage is a
shaxtal, with new dialog/slightly buffed abilities).
-you can now upgrade companions' stats at forges (in multiplayer, the
upgrades are shared between players)
-added a miniboss fight at depth 25, introducing the players to the chaos empire (the minotaur/warlock fight was moved
to depth 30 (as I felt there were too few depths between depth 20 and entering the underworld), and the depth 30 spiderqueen rematch has been
removed).
-new upgrades: Algadur I/Algadur II, Elizabeth I/Elizabeth II,
Quick Recovery I/Quick Recovery II (all companion upgrades),
Amulet Charge (reduces the phoenix amulet cooldown. available
after the Phoenix Amulet upgrade), Regeneration (you recover 2 hp
every turn (while it may seen very small in theory, in practice
it's actually really useful as long as you don't keep taking too much
damage). Available after Armor II/beating spiderqueen)
-added a Chaos Empire enemy category. They have a roughly 33% chance to
appear instead of cave/dungeon enemies after depth 25. They have units even
stronger than the ones in jungle depths, but with roughly 25% fewer units to
compensate for that.
-new enemies: Chaos Invader, Chaos Bowman, Chaos Headhunter (basically a
stronger goblin cutthroat), Storm Demon (strong ranged unit with
the ability to teleport. appears past depth 26)
-added music for the depth 35 dialog (the new boss fights use existing music)
-implemented a proper campaign description
-new achievement: Shaxtal Exterminator (beat the archmage on depth 35)
-jungle depths now appear past depth 15 instead of 20, but witchdoctors only
appear starting from depth 18, and wyverns from depth 22
-elizabeth no longer has the ability to summon fire guardians from the
start, as it is now one of her upgrades
-reworked the astral guardian/archmage teleport away abilities to be
ability/ai-based, rather than event-based (one of the main effects
of this that the teleportation happens due to how close enemies
are, rather than due to getting hit)
-added a debug option to change your maximum energy
-the "prometheus' fire"	artifact has been renamed to "prometheus' heart",
as it sounds a bit more fitting
-flame blast III now reduces the ability's cooldown from 4 turns to 3 (so
that the upgrade is a bit more viable)
-the fact that enemies are buffed is now mentioned in the multiplayer objectives
-added enemy catalog entries for minotaur/warlock
-demon warriors now have their own race
-algadur/elizabeth now have each three random lines for when catching up to the player
(it's still pretty repetitive, but not as much as before)
-in multiplayer, the debug menu messages are now only shown to the current side
-fixed text items being able to spawn on the entrance or exit
-fixed demon warriors' ranged attacks not working
-fixed algadur not returning after fleeing
-fixed companions not returning after fleeing while in the underworld
-fixed the flame blast II upgrade not working in multiplayer
-fixed spear throw range I not unlocking Flame Blast in singleplayer

Beta 2 Changelog:
-the add-on folder has been renamed from Hoplite to Spartan, for
consistency with the campaign name/the fact that the music pack is
called Spartan_Music
-new upgrades: Teleport II (the leap/teleport range is now increased from 2
tiles to 3. available after Teleport/beating spiderqueen. Now the
energy path should be a bit less underpowered), Harpoon II (the
harpoon effect can be used two times per depth. available after
Harpoon/beating spiderqueen), Sword Lunge (the shortsword now
deals 5 more damage when leaping, meaning that with the hit and run
upgrade, it can sometimes be more than just a backup weapon for
when the spear is on the ground. available after Hit and
Run (I'm considering making it post-spiderqueen, but I'm not too
sure, so I'd like to hear your opinion on the matter)), Shield
Wall (The shield up upgrade effect is activated when you skip your turn
.available after shield up/patience. Now there's a proper shield
tree, instead of just a few upgrades. The upgrade could use a
better name, though, so I'm open to ideas.)
-new enemies: Nagini Mage (encountered past depth 15, and is basically a
mix of naga hunter and dark adept. oh, and the hydras are
now a post-depth-20 enemy), Lava Tentacle (encountered in cave depths
past 25)
-added an option to start from depth 31, as between depth 21 and 41,
there's also the underworld besides the 20 normal depths
-added two new dungeon depth presets, with portals
-renamed the "spear of ares" artifact to "Athena's spear" and "Artemis'
	shortsword" to "Ares' Blade"
-the adrenaline rush now recovers half of your current maximum energy
instead of a fixed number (making it more useful in the later
depths, particularly once you have the Prometheus' Fire)
-the enthrall ability now has a 3-turn cooldown to make it a bit less
overpowered if you have lots of energy.
-reduces the harpoon cooldown that prevents you from throwing the spear
normally afterwards from 5 turns to 3 (as the 5-turn cooldown
feels a bit too harsh
in hindsight, and 3 turns as a cooldown is enough to prevent
people using the spear twice a turn)
-buffed the energy III upgrade to give 30 energy instead of 25
-hydras now regenerate 5 hp per turn instead of 4
-added a new attack icon to the abyssal tentacles
-renamed "Spartan (local multiplayer test)" to "Spartan (local multiplayer mode)"
-fire guardians are now more likely to spawn on lava lakes instead of
normal ground	.
-updated the hoplite guide a bit
-fixed the trapdoor not working on depths past 25
-fixed rats spawning as colossal even with just the first rat power upgrade
-fixed the depth 41 starting option not giving the 50 max energy from the
prometheus' fire
-fixed the adrenaline rush upgrade not working
-fixed the enragement effect instantly wearing off for the second player
before they can attack
-fixed abyssal tentacles not being immune to knockback (allowing them to be
easily killed by knocking them into the very chasms they inhabit)
-fixed faceless knight/abyssal tentacle entries being immediately unlocked
when you enter the underworld
-fixed the thrown spear lingering on the ground even if the killed enemy
is the last one in the depth
-fixed the harpoon cooldown not being reset when killing the last enemy on
the map with the spear (since the cooldown was applied after the
depth descent event).
-fixed the impassable cave path terrain having id conflict with the
mainline cave path
-hopefully fixed the archers' weird aim in the dungeon depth

Beta 1 Changelog:
-added a new boss fight at depth 30 (minotaur&warlock duo)
-added companions (right now there's only two, but I may add more later). They act like your normal allies, but do not
disappear on descending a depth, recover half hp when
descending, and talk in some situations. One of them is encountered instead of the first runesmith
-added text items like signposts (they randomly appear in depths, and
contain random bits of text/lore, as well as something extra in
the underworld...)
-added a proper objective to the campaign: retrieving the Prometheus' fire
from depth 40, and exiting at any subsequent depth. You still can
continue in the repetitive endless mode after depth 40.
-instead of just the two "start from depth 1/start from depth 21" options,
there are more. (and they are now stored in global variables
separate from achievements). There is also an option to start the
game with debug as a reward for reaching depth 100 (yes, the debug
menu is currently available in normal gameplay, but that will be
changed near the release). Also, the starting depth global
variables can be cleared at the bottom of the achievements menu.
-new upgrades: Enthrall (available after shadow clone/beating archmage), Enthrall
II (available after Enthrall/beating avatar of war), Energy IV (available after Energy
III/beating avatar of war), Shadow Clone III (available after
Shadow Clone II/beating avatar of war), Rat King (available after
Colossal Rats/beating avatar of war), Sweeping Bash (available
from the start)
-the exit stairway has been moved from depth 20 to depth 50 (so players
don't miss out on the content past depth 20)
-new enemies: Abyssal Tentacle (spawns in the underworld), Possessed Armor
(spawns in dungeon depths past depth 15)
-added many new achievements
-the grim reaper boss has been made more difficult (more hp, more minions,
recovering some hp after being at half hp, drain special on melee, and slowing all nearby
side 3/4 units (allies) upon shadow cloning), and now has dialog
upon being defeated. Now the fight should be a good deal more
intense.
-added dialog to the archmage, to explain why he is attacking the hero.
-the second spear throw range upgrade now also increases spear throw damage by 5,
but is now post-spiderqueen
-renamed the "Hoplite Debug" menu to "Spartan Debug"
-updated the hoplite guide to mention the new mechanics/enemies
-uncommented the bloodlustIII/frenzy events
-the hero can now be renamed
-allies now wander randomly if there are no enemies nearby, instead of
freezing in place.
-the "skip to depth x" debug option no longer allows you to reset the
depths you already passed
-ranged units (except ones with the slow special) no longer need to wait a
turn after attacking before being able to charge up/aim again (Their
attacks are still rather easy to dodge, but now at least they will
be a bit more effective at their job)
-the dark portals no longer spawn you as far in the underworld
-renamed the berserk achievement to "warrior", and added a new "berserk"
achievement, which is killing killing at least one enemy per turn
for 12 turns in a row (which fits the berserk name much better
than killing at least 30 enemies in one playthrough, something
pretty much everyone will do anyway)
-renamed the current "rat king" upgrade to "rat army"
-the "crusader"/"where no man has ever gone" achievements now require
reaching depths 28/100 instead of 25/99 respectively.
-depths past 40 are now super tightly packed with enemies
-secret achievements/their requirements are now visible in the achievement menu, but their
names are hidden.
-cloning proficiency now only reduces the energy cost to 80 instead of 75
-the "skip x depths" debug option no longer accepts negative numbers,
instead, the depth is increased if above 0 depth, and decreased if
below
-you can now no longer return to the negative depths; you enter them at
depth 25 and leave at depth -10 and that's it (for not, at least,
as the underworld has rather little content at the moment)
-corrected the teleportaway upgrade description
-optimized the ratsIV event
-kills done by ally units now give half the normal energy you'd get from
attacking enemies yourself (and to both
players, if in multiplayer)
-the {HOPLITE_SCATTER_ENEMY} macro now uses variables as input, instead of
having the macro used in every depth type individually. This
should help the performance a bit, as the macro was quite heavy
given its usage of {SCATTER_UNITS}
-fire guardians now have 50% resistance vs fire
-changed the reaper/avatar of war fight maps a bit
-lvl0 units (spider minions) now receive a hp buff in multiplayer too (but
only 3 more hp instead of 5). This will make them no longer
one-shotted by rats with the "frenzied rats" upgrade
-portals now have ~NO_TOD_SHIFT(), which should make them stand out a bit
more
-underworld scatter unit events now use the {HOPLITE_SCATTER_ENEMY} macro
like all others
-the hoplite death event macro is now an event instead of a macro, for
the sake of code optimization
-slightly optimized the ranged event by putting multiple similar unit
types into one archery macro
-the {CHATMSG} macro now only comes into effect when spartan debug is on
(however, the {IF_VAR}s may slightly worsen performance)
-ranged units are now filtered by a [dummy] ability instead of unit types,
making filtering them a bit easier.
-fixed the underworld music not triggering if you enter the underworld via
the "skip to depth x" option
-fixed the exploding spear animation not playing if the spear throw doesn't kill the target
-fixed rat power upgrades not taking into account the players that the
rats were spawned by (side 1 rat power upgrades buffed rats
spawned by side 1, and side 2 rat power upgrades didn't work
entirely)
-fixed impale III not working
-fixed a bug that made enemies receive wall-bash damage even if they were
knocked into normal terrain.
-fixed a spear throw variation issue in multiplayer
-fixed kills done by allies giving twice the normal energy to the player.
-fixed the serpent mage's ability not working
-fixed a bug with the grim reaper fight
-fixed a fade_to_black bug with the portals
-fixed shadow clone costing no energy at all with cloning proficiency
-fixed the "skip to depth x" debug option not working correctly with
negative depths
-fixed the lesser knockback ability knocking units into walls
multiple times in one attack
-fixed the hero's hitpoints being reset to 40 at the start of the turn
(they still reset to that number upon depth descent, but still)
-fixed jungle walls not being treated as walls by some mechanics
-fixed the ranged target hex bugfix not affecting the bottom/top walls.
-fixed the random red-shifted ToD having a chance to appear on boss depths
by accident
-fixed the short-ranged special not working for allies (matters because of
the new Enthrall upgrade)
-fixed the 5-turn harpoon cooldown not working properly in multiplayer

Alpha 10 Changelog:
-drastically improved the game's performance (the long delay
between turns is no longer present) with much of code being
optimized
-added a rightclick option to switch places with your teammate in multiplayer
-enemies with the coward ai no longer flee if the hoplite is on the other
side of wall (due to [filter_radius])
-normal enemies have 5 more hitpoints in multiplayer
-enemy knockback attacks now only not deal damage if the base damage was 1
-water depths can no longer appear on depth 2. this should make the
difficulty curve smoother
-removed the "disable automatic movement for this depth" debug option, as
it wasn't all that useful, and made dummy-unit-utilizing events buggy
-yet another fix for target hexes appearing in random locations (the old
one didn't work that well)
-short-ranged special events now no longer use different events each
-fixed rest/restII/ambush upgrades not working in multiplayer
-fixed a teamcolor issue with the Goblin Cutthroat
-fixed saurian blowgunner's target hexes not disappearing
-fixed upgrade [object]s not working in the singleplayer debug menu
-fixed the hero becoming stuck after trying to attack from the exit
-fixed rats being unable to spawn on jungle depths

Alpha 9,1 Changelog
-removed an unnecessary knockback macro (which originally intended to be
used for a knockback range upgrade, but didn't work)
-the forge menu now uses [fire_event] to reduce code amount. However, I'm
not sure if replacing macros with events improves performance or
worsens it.
-optimized the shadow clone menu (it no longer uses the shadowclone macro
multiple times, now relying on variables for the macro's input
instead). same with the variation check event, and the adrenaline
rush event (however, the adrenaline event doesn't work yet)
-fixed spear throw range upgrades not working for in multiplayer

Alpha 9 Changelog:
-added jungle depths, with new enemies and terrain (appearing past depth
20. As for the enemies, they are even more challenging/unique than
the ones in the water depths (many even having their own micro
ais), but there aren't as many enemies in total)
-new enemies: Salamander, Saurian Blowgunner, Saurian Augur, Saurian
Witchdoctor, Wyvern (all encountered in jungle depths)
-new upgrades: Chameleon (available after the patience upgrade/beating
archmage.), Impale III (available after impale II/beating spider queen)
-made it so that only the add-on exclusive units are shown in the help menu
-now depth 100 has only the stairway exit (for now it's a placeholder
"true ending", until I further expand upon the concept)
-buffed spider queen's ranged attack from 1-1 to 4-1
-copied enemy catalog entries into most unit descriptions
-improved the underworld portals' menus a bit
-standardized ranged slow attack events
-renamed "Spider Minion" to "Spiderling", and "Dark Wizard" to
"Dark Adept"
-if you get both the impale and impale II upgrades, there will only be the
impale II weapon special shown in the help menu (to reduce clutter)
-buffed the spider queen's web attack (now it deals 4 damage instead of 1), but made her unable to use both charge and web attacks on the same turn
-cuttlefish now no longer have a -tile blind spot, but are also no longer
able to use the melee attack after using their ink attack.
-moved the "immunity to knockback" upgrade next to the armor upgrades on
the list, as the upgrade is unlocked by Improved Armor I
-added a avatar of war/faceless knight/jungle enemy entries in the enemy catalog
-tweaked some enemy catalog entries
-added a lurker micro ai for the enemy side, so the enemies randomly move
if they can't see the player(s). This is done to make the
chameleon upgrade not ridiculously OP (as it can be used alongside
rest II to fully recover hp/energy if not moving for a while)
-moved most enemy ranged attack events into a single event, to hopefully
reduce lag a bit (additionally, some of the enemy/boss death events
were moved to a single event with [switch]). Now the amount of
events should be a bit less ridiculous.
-reduced the amount of macros inside macros a bit
-fixed the second player being automatically moved on 5,2 in the "auto
	move to exit" event (as it obstructed in the stairway in depths
past 20)
-instead of fixed values, teleportaway energy cost now uses an algorithm to scale with the enemy attack
damage for melee attacks (with a 75 energy to 10
enemy damage ratio)
-made some variables automatically cleared, to reduce clutter a bit.
-depth descent now utilizes [fire_event] instead of a macro, to reduce the
amount of code/hopefully improve performance a bit (as the depth descent
macro is probably the most macro-filled macro in the entire add-on)
-fixed the teleportaway/shield up/adrenaline rush upgrades not working in multiplayer
(however, the teleportaway may be a bit buggy when two players are
teleporting away at once, like when in the line of fire of an archer)
-fixed the enemy ranged attack target hexes appearing in random locations
when trying to fire at a wall (the previous fix didn't always work)
-fixed avatar of war's leap away ability triggering even when the boss's
hp was above half
-fixed a fake trapdoor at 6,2 being visible if skipping to depths past 20
without entering depth 20 first
-fixed hoplites not losing their spear upon spear throw in multiplayer

Alpha 8,5 Changelog:
-added randomly appearing event depths (for now there's only the "save a
	runesmith to get a free upgrade" depth, but I may add more eventually)
-forges now appears every 3 depths instead of 2 after depth 30, so players
are less likely to easily get all upgrades (the same applies to
the negative depths, as they can be somewhat abused to get many upgrade
without progressing in the normal depths)
-the archmage fight now uses the same custom ToD as the avatar of war fight
-normal depths now have a chance to have the red-shifted ToD (like the one
used in the
avatar of war fight)}
-made some of the enemies able to spawn on sand in the water depths
-new enemy: faceless knight (appears in the underworld)
-reduced the amount of macros used inside other macros, as well as
reducing the amount of macros used in general, in favor of other
methods, making the lag a bit less unbearable (from roughly 6.8
seconds to roughly 5.4)
-nerfed orc grunts' melee from 10-1 to 8-1 (after all, they're supposed to
be the second-weakest enemy in the entire add-on)
-negative depths now have a custom ToD, and use abyss chasms as borders
-removed the "something's not right" message when entering the underworld,
as the background does a good job of hinting at that in my opinion.
-dungeon depths can no longer appear in the negative depths (now only the
default depth type will always appear, but I may later change that
by adding new depth types to the underworld)
-fixed the depth -10 boss's abilities not working properly in multiplayer
-fixed the shadow clone II ugprade not working in multiplayer, and made it
no longer possible to summon a clone when there are no empty
adjacent hexes
-fixed some enemy catalog entries no longer appearing when in the
underworld (since the enemy catalog used to check the current depth, rather than the depths actually passed)

Alpha 8 Changelog:
-added a "Spartan (local multiplayer test)" option to the campaign menu
(quite a revolutionary addition. I had to rewrite a decent amount
of the code for the add-on to implement it)
-new enemies: demon warrior (an almost miniboss-like unit that appears in cave levels past depth 25)
-removed the colossal rats nerf, and rat legion now has a 3-turn cooldown
if you don't have the frenzied/colossal rats' upgrades, instead of
the default 4
-the artifact variant of hoplite now uses TC instead of red (for the
multiplayer mode)
-adjusted most mechanics of the add-on to work in the multiplayer mode
-renamed the "Spear Guardian" boss to "Avatar of War", and made him use a
custom race
-the amount of enemies is increased by 50% when in
multiplayer, (realistically speaking, I may need to increase the
enemy amount for the early depths even further, but it's better
than nothing), and bosses are noticeably stronger.
-the "push ally" option	now can be used on the other player (to give them
a speed boost in a given location, or move them out of an archer's
line of fire, for example. It has potential for advanced
teamplay, as well as trolling.)
-the enemy catalog (bestiary) entries now specify where an enemy can
be encountered, and I improved a few of the entries
-added an error message for when the "push ally" fails, saying "ally can't
	be pushed there!"
-gave giant spiders a ranged web, identical to that of the spider queen
-hydras now are now unable to regenerate when slowed (to make fightning hydras
actually involve some strategy, instead of the only option being
to keep attacking until they die)
-Demilich/Serpent Mage can have weak melee attacks that they use if they have
nowhere to flee	(or there is an ally next to the next they flee to)
-renamed the "Void Explorer" achievement to "Underworld Explorer", as
underworld is now the official name I've now given to the negative depths
-added an enemy catalog entries about underworld boss/giant spider
-most enemy catalog entries are now made available when you choose the
"start at depth 21" option
-made all Spartan units use custom movetypes, for the sake of
standardization (in case I add new terrain in future map types,
which isn't unlikely)
-added a custom ToD at depth 20
-added a debug option to obtain the artifacts
-removed the unnecessary "#ifver"s from the skeleton archer's file, as I
don't intend to release Spartan for 1.12 anyway
-split the unit images into different folders in the images/units
-fixed the spectre mage entry being unable to show up
-the shadowclone II upgrade's hitpoint increase now applies to clones
spawned before taking the upgrade
-now bosses' minions all instantly die when their respective bosses get
killed
-the information menu now has an option to see your teammate's upgrades
-removed the backstab special from goblin cutthroats, as they were
threatening enough without it, and rarely seem to actually use the
special
-increased the amount of revives needed for the "Not today, Death!" achievement
-made it so that the end turn option doesn't ask an "are you sure" question.
-partially fixed units with the "short-ranged" special sometimes not
attacking
-moved some of the code from the scenario file into a macro file
-fixed the spelunker achievement message still appearing, even though I
removed the achievement
-fixed the depth 20 boss's explosion attack being classified as melee, and
added a dummy special to briefly describe how the attack works.
-fixed some of the upgrades not showing up in the "show your current
	upgrades" menu

Alpha 7 Changelog:
-added a boss at depth -10 (I'm not sure if he's difficult enough for the
stage of the game at which you encounter him, though)
-added a soundtrack to the Spartan Music pack for the new boss (this time
from UMC)
-changed the soundtrack used by the spear guardian to
"gathering_storm.ogg" from IftU (as the old one didn't
quite fit)
-the later depths are now more tightly-packed with enemies (previously,
depths stopped increasing in difficulty a bit too early). With the
difficulty increase, it may be a good idea to remove the colossal
rats nerf.
-added a victory event (something I really should have done a lot sooner)
-the hero now uses a recolored sprite for when he has the artifact gear
-added a new artifact: shortsword of artemis (so that the swordsword is
not quite as useless in later depths, at least being able to two-shot
enemies with 15 health, such as monster crabs)
-new upgrades: Flame Blast III (available after Flame Blast II/beating
spear guardian), Explosive Spear (available after the first spear
throw range upgrade)
-new achievement: Angel of Death
-reworked improved armor III to increases resistances rather than max hp
(both for originality and as a partial workaround for a weird
bug. Doesn't stack with the shield up upgrade's effect for balance
reasons)
-new campaign icon
-the tightness of enemy clusters now depends on the amount of enemies
being spawned, instead of the depth.
-some progress with implementing the multiplayer mode. (including
reworking leap to work with it, as well as increasing the amount
of enemies spawned, for balance)
-portals now store the depth you entered them from (for example, if you
enter at depth 24, when you use the return portal, you return to
depth 25, and if you enter from depth -10, you'll return to depth -10)
-buffed the teleport away upgrade: it now slows all enemies near your destination (now the upgrade should no longer drain as much
of your energy from enemies chain-attacking the hero)
-removed "(may not always work)" from the flame blast menu option, as it's
no longer relevant
-the upgrade menu in the "start at depth 21" option now shows you how many
upgrades you have left.
-removed the music credits from the campaign description, as I intend to
put it in the Spartan Music _server.pbl file
-the harpoon upgrade now lets you throw your spear into water when not on
cooldown (to make spear throwing a bit more viable)
-added a new attack icon for spear throw, for when getting the spear of ares
-dark portals now only appears in depth 25 and beyond (as there is a
possibility of the portal appearing on depth 21, which isn't
something I want in terms of pacing)
-added another dungeon depth preset because why not.
-made some achievements harder to obtain. as they were quite easy to
complete without even trying to. (the main example being the
berserk/warmonger/god of war achievements)
-removed the spelunker achievement, as it is too easy to obtain to really
be classified as an achievement
-buffed spectre mage hitpoints from 10 to 15 (while they're still
one-shotted by the hoplite's spear, they at least aren't as easily
killed by allies)
-mausoleums no longer use cave terrain to be unwalkable (instead, there is
a custom version of the dark bricks that counts as cave terrain)
-fixed Spear of Ares buffing flame blast
-fixed flame blast II not working
-fixed ranged units' targethexes appearing in random coordinates when
firing into a wall.
-fixed some non-player units being able to attack after being slowed
(including rats)
-fixed teleportaway not being able to teleport onto terrain with overlays
(such as the spawn location)
-fixed music not changing back properly after killing a boss
-fixed spear throw range II buffing wizardbeam
-fixed the ability to cast the flame blast ability through walls.

Alpha 6 Changelog:
-if you have beaten the depth 20 boss, you can now start playing from
depth 21, with the artifacts/10 upgrades. (the option is activated
by an achievement, so clearing achievements removes it)
-reworked map generation in negative depths
-new upgrades: Adrenaline Rush (Available after Energy I), Shield Up
(available from the start), Shield Up II (available after Shield
Up.), Harpoon (available from the start), Flame Blast II
(available after Flame Blast)
-flame blast no longer replaces spear throw, instead being an extra attack
(to balance things out, flame blast is no longer affected by spear
throw upgrades). After all, the two attacks serve quite different purposes.
-made ranged units less passive: they now advance towards the hero when
far enough away (they still flee when you get close, and remain
still when you're at medium range)
-renamed "Armor of Ares" to "Hephaestus' Platemail"
-nerfed the Colossal Rats upgrade: it now reduces the amount of rats
spawned, and increases the rat legion cooldown
-improved the short-ranged special's random target selection
-slightly increased the probability of dark portals appearing
-you can no longer throw a spear through walls
-poltergeists can longer be seen through walls
-increased flame blast cooldown from 3 turns to 4
-flame blast now uses target hex images to help players aim it.
-rewritten the wizard beam entry in the hoplite guide
-fixed shadow clone not working
-fixed depth descent not working properly in negative depths
-fixed a critical bug with flame blast (now it can actually be properly aimed)

Alpha 5 Changelog:
-moved the addon music into a separate "Spartan Music" add-on, and compressed
tracks except the background theme for the sake of download time
-added a new soundtrack for the depth 20 boss (by the same composer as the
rest of the Spartan music)
-added an eerie soundtrack for negative depths (again, by the same composer)
-if the music pack isn't installed, the custom music will be replaced with
fitting-ish default tracks (this change is mainly aimed toward
people with slow internet speed)
-added a new enemy type to the negative depths: Mage Specter
-new achievement: Void Explorer (secret achievement for getting to depth -10)
-new upgrade: Bloodlust III (available after Bloodlust II/beating spiderqueen)
-slightly expanded the spear guardian fight
-removed "generate lava"/"spawn random orc enemies", as both were no
longer actually useful, and the latter was outdated.
-added a dark portal debug option
-replaced fog clearers the "Disable automatic movement to exit for this
	depth" debug option with the add-on's invisible dummy units
-replaced "side=2" with "side=$hoplite_enemyside" and "side=3" with
"side=$hoplite_allyside" in many files, in preparation for the eventual
multiplayer edition
-standardized archer attack events, like with the short-ranged special
standardization from the previous alpha
-fixed ranged being able to hit	hoplite on other ranged units' target
hexes without chargeup, as well as made them able to target allies
-when killing archers, now not all target hex images on the screen are removed
(the new method is not exactly perfect, but certainly superior to
the old one.)
-lingering target hexes are removed when there are no ranged units nearby
(this method, again, is not the greatest, but still better than
what we had before)
-water depth are no longer able to appear in negative depths
-cuttlefish now have blue target hex images
-removed the faerie fire sound from the rat legion upgrade effect (it was
used for testing whether the ability triggers or not) and replaced
it with a squeak
-added a roman numeral overlay to bloodlust II
-fixed a bug with the "automatically skip turn if slowed" feature

Alpha 4 Changelog:
-renamed the add-on from "Hoplite" to "Spartan" (though I'm still yet to
rename the add-on folder/variables)
-added content to the secret negative depths (as well as a non-debug way
to get into them via a portal. Such portals have a small chance of
appearing in depths past 20).
-added an achmage rematch at depth 35
-new achievement: Rat Master (not to be confused with an upgrade of the
same name)
-new upgrades: Colossal Rats (available after Frenzied Rats/beating
spiderqueen.), Ambush (allies aren't targeted by enemies on the
first turn of entering a depth, preventing the issue of most
allies getting slaughtered after spawning), Cloning Proficiency
(available after Shadow Clone. It's basically the shadow clone
equivalent of the potion bag upgrade, except with an energy cost
reduction as a bonus)
-removed the "Advantage of Surprise" upgrade, as it was quite weak in my
opinion (I may consider reworking it later)
-slightly buffed the Rest/Rest II upgrades' energy regeneration (5 to 8
and 8 to 10 respectively), as the upgrades, while decent-ish in early
depths, were quite underpowered later on
-added an option to push adjacent allied units via a rightclick option on
them (it's a bit limited, as it can't push units when there's
unwalkable/impassable terrain behind them, but should suffice for
most cases of rats blocking the way (other can be dealt with using
the "order nearby allies to move here" option))
-removed AMLA from most units, except allies
-fixed the forge debug option making actual forges turn un-usable
-fixed rat legion not working, and made it a post-archmage upgrade
-fixed impale II not working on enemies with the "short-ranged" special
(now the upgrade will be actually viable)
-fixed the upgrade menu not working during boss fights
-added Giant Spider: an enemy type present in the spider queen rematch
-Spider Queen/Spider Minion unit types no longer share the same file.
-the short-ranged special's events are now in macro, instead of being put
individually in each unit file, for easier future editing/making
the code cleaner.

Alpha 3,5 Changelog:
-added many new achievements
-achievements are now stored in global variaboles, meaning that they carry
over between playthroughs
-added "Unlock all achievements"/"Clear All Achievements" options to the
debug menu
-made certain enemies unable to attack when slowed (this custom rule already
applied to most enemies, but enemies like goblin
cutthroat/tentacle are still able to attack). This should slightly
buff shield bashing/spear throwing, as both utilize the slow
effect (which in the addon is more akin to a stun mechanic)
-added an option to clear achievement progress at the bottom of the
achievement list.
-expanded the monster crab documentation a bit to mention that they can
killed without taking damage by a spear throw/shortsword combo

Alpha 3 Changelog:
-added a boss to depth 20 (for now he's quite placeholder-y (in terms of concept) and doesn't
have a unique soundtrack)
-depths past 20 give an option to either continue further below (with a
stat bonus), or end (the ending hasn't been implemented yet, though)
the campaign (finally adding an objective to the campaign)
-added a rematch with the spider queen at depth 30 (not much of an
objective, and more of a filler for the otherwise boring endless mode)
-added an achievement system (it's still very WIP, though, so the
achievement variety is quite limited at the moment)
-added a new enemy type: Hydra (encountered on water depths past 15)
-added a new dungeon map preset, with randomly generated walls.
-new upgrades: Potion Bag (available after healing potion I), Spear move
(Allow moving and/or attacking after spear throw/wizard beam), Phoenix
Amulet II (available after Phoenix Amulet and Healing Potion II),
Rat legion (available after the Rat king upgrade)
-now the amount of enemies doesn't increase as fast after depth 10 (the
amount of enemies now increases by 1 every 2 depths. (example:
instead of 14 enemies, there are now 12, and instead of 20 there
are now 15) The change
doesn't decrease the amount of enemies too heavily, but it
certainly should make the difficulty not increase too fast)
-shadow clones are now immune to knockback
-added an entry about flame blast in to the hoplite guide
-fixed spider queen being classified as male
-fixed inability to move to the exit if there is an ally there
-added white flashes upon boss deaths
-made forges no longer usable during boss fights

Alpha 2,5 Changelog:
-added an enemy catalog in the information menu (more entries become
available as you encounter new enemy types)
-added a few preset minions to the depth 15 boss
-added an event for when you use the "Skip to X depth" menu with a
negative number, for fun.
-fixed a bug with the "Skip X depths" debug option
-fixed a bug with the armor upgrades
-tweaked the enemy generation a bit (now they don't spawn in a 2-tile
radius of the hero, instead of avoiding specific coordinates)

Alpha 2 Changelog:
-new upgrade: Teleport Away (available after beating archmage/unlocking
teleport. Might be rather underpowered at the moment in my
opinion, with its overly high energy cost)
-new icons for Teleport/Frenzied Rats upgrades
-new enemies: Poltergeist (appears in dungeon levels instead of some
spearmen, starting from depth 12), Mud Golem (appears in cave
levels, starting from depth 16), Serpent Mage (appears in water
depths starting from depth 11)
-fire guardians now spawn starting from depth 12
-moved the message about the help menu from storytxt to the campaign
description.
-added roman numeral overlays to healing potion II/III
-extended the duration of the "not enough energy" messages, as they
disappeared a bit too fast in my opinion.
-fixed the [unstore_unit] bug being present in the lesser knockback special
-fixed an instance of MAGENTA_IS_THE_TEAM_COLOR
-fixed inability to leap on bridges
-buffed Shadow Clone II/Frenzied Rats abilities
-enemies are now able to spawn in more tightly-packed clusters. This
change may not seem too big, until you actually try out the later
depths. (as most of the enemies previously didn't spawn, the later
levels now are quite hectic/difficult. I'll
have to buff the bosses (for example, the depth 15 boss is quite
beatable even without upgrades, and a bit easy with them), and possibly make the forge even more common)

Alpha 1,5 Changelog:
-added an information menu (can be accessed via rightclick menu
anywhere. Has a hoplite guide (explains most of the core
mechanics), as well as an option to show a list of all your
current upgrades, instead of having to memorize which ones you
have (the latter addition is quite fitting for the menu, and should
make it useful even for those who know the mechanics well))
-added storytxt mentioning the information menu
-fire guardians are now immune to knockback (previously you could kill
them by knocking them into lava, which was rather absurd.)
-fixed a bug with spear throwing (about [unstore_unit] when the target's
been killed)

Alpha 1 (Demo 9) Changelog
-introduced a brand new mechanic: AI-controlled allies (I also added a
rightclick menu to direct their movement, so that they don't block
your way/can be moved out of the ranged attackers' line of
fire). Though eventually, it would be a good idea to split the
feature from hoplite into an extra character/class
-new upgrades: Rat Tamer (utilizing the revolutionary mechanic of
allied units in this addon. These loyal rodents are too weak
to face off against melee enemies, but do quite a good job at
hunting down archers), Rat master, Rat King, Frenzied Rats
(available after Rat Tamer, makes individual rats a bit less weak), Shadow
Clone (available after Rat Tamer/beating spider queen), Shadow
Clone II, Healing Potion III (unlocked after beating the spider
queen), Energizing Healing (available after healing potion)
-updated the long-ranged/shortranged enemy attacks to work better with the newly
introduced ally mechanics (like targeting side 3 too, and only
attacking one unit at a time (wizards being an exception))
-add new phoenix amulet/healpotion II icon
-fire guardians can now move on unwalkable terrain, and spawn in the cave
depths after depth 15 instead of some of the grunts
-allowed leaping over water
-replaced the current campaign description with "TODO"
-upgraded versions now have roman numeral overlays, if they don't have a
custom icon (such as armor II/III, energy II,III, impale II, etc.)
-cuttlefish now no longer spawn 3 tentacles upon apperance (as they used
to be a bit too strong for a non-boss enemy)
-replaced the buggy "spawn forge" debug menu option with one that opens an
upgrade menu directly (now testing upgrades should be far, far
less of a pain in the butt)
-fixed the "[unstore_unit]: variable 'knockbacked' doesn't exist" bug, as
well as hopefully the spider queen knockback bug

Demo 8,1 Changelog
-fixed impale not working
-fixed the spiked shield upgrade dealing 4 damage on hit instead of the
intended 5
-fixed the hit and run special not ending turn when fleeing next to
another enemy

Demo 8 Changelog:
-added a new map type with unique obstacles/powerful foes: the flooded caves. (This should spice things up, as
previously there were only 2 semi-randomized map types: caves and dungeons)
-new upgrades: Flame Blast (replacement for the spear throw, available
after the first spear throw range upgrade, and buffed by the
second. requires beating the depth 15 boss to be available)
-replaced the shortsword cleave upgrade with a new one (now the shortsword
will be at least viable vs enemies with the "short-ranged" special
and more than 10 hp)
-added 2 new dungeon map presets
-buffed the healing potion II upgrade: now the heal amount increase is 10
instead of 5
-now undead spearmen spawned by demiliches can no longer attack the same turn
they're spawned (before, it was rather unfair), and demiliches'
summoning cooldown is 1 turn longer. The former change is also
applied to all other summoning enemies
-now the hero receives 10 damage if knocked into lava (in case I add a
knockback-using unit to the cave map type)
-fixed the "automatic move to exit/forge" feature not working if the last kill
was done by shield bashing an enemy into lava
-fixed demilich using human death sounds
-fixed the forge debug menu option not working
-fixed your turn not getting skipped if you're slowed and not next to an enemy
-updated a decent amount of deprecated code

Demo 7 bugfix 2 Changelog:
-fixed shield not slowing the target enemy after bashing it into a wall.
-fixed upgrades not working when auto-moving on a forge after killing
enemies

Demo 7 bugfix 1 Changelog:
-fixed shield bash not slowing in 1.14

Demo 7 Changelog:
-reworked lava generation (now lava tends to generates in more unified bodies,
instead of 1-tile puddles sprinkled across the map)
-added music for the bosses, by the same author as the background theme's (tell me whether it fits or not)
-added minions to the depth 15 boss (he was a bit too easy for the stage
of the game during which the played would fight him)
-descending a depth now restores half of your max hp worth of hitpoints,
instead of 10.
-removed the depth healing upgrade (due to the aforementioned depth
healing buff)
-new upgrades: Healing Potion, Healing Potion II, Phoenix Amulet
-slightly increased the amount of initial spiders during the spider queen fight
-spider queen how shoots her web in a 3-tile line, somewhat like archers.
-fixed line attacks not working on 1.14.x
-replaced placement=map_passable with placement=map/passable=yes for
summoner enemies
-fixed spider queen/dark wizard target hex images not disappearing after death
-fixed a bug with the depth 15 boss's attacks.
-added a recruit anim for zombie spearman (for when summoned by a demilich)
-added campaign image (for now it's just a portrait of Dedylos. Later, it
would be amazing to have a custom campaign image, with the hero
standing next to some sort of chasm or cave/dungeon entrance)

Demo 6 Changelog:
-added a new boss at depth 15 (unlike the spider queen, this one is more
ranged-focused, with no minions at the moment)
-forges now appear every 2 depths
-new upgrades: Bloodlust, Bloodlust II, Rest II and Advantage of Surprise
-added third tiers to armor/energy upgrades (only available after beating the
spider queen)
-archers now have a 1-tile longer reach, but have a 1-tile blind spot next
to them
-reworked dark wizards: now they're sort of like upgraded archers.
-new enemy: Demilich (found in dungeons, summons undead spearmen every 3
turns)
-boss depths are no longer skippable (you have to beat the boss in order
to be able to move to the exit)
-fixed orc archer death anim
-fixed hoplite skipping a depth after using a forge for the first time
-fixed enemies not being slowed after being bashed into a wall
-fixed archers being able to shoot through walls
-fixed some of the bugs occuring when two types of ranged units are shooting at once.
-fixed Impale II not having effect on some units
-fixed the leap menu option being usable even while leap is already enabled

Demo 5 Changelog:
-added new enemies utilizing a revolutionary ranged attack mechanic: orc archer/skeleton archer

Demo 4 Changelog
-added spear throwing (the ability was rather underpowered in the original Hoplite
game in my opinion, but here, with the plentiful melee units, it's
a bit more viable)
-resized the mausoleum terrain icon
-nerfed the impale upgrade (now it only hits the second target if the
first one was killed. The change doesn't affect the usual
applications of the special, but prevents hitting weak units
shielded by tougher ones)
-new upgrades: Teleport (available after the first energy upgrade), Rest
(available after Patience), Impale II, and two spear throw range upgrades
-added a hoplite-specific debug menu that can be accessed with "set_var
	hoplite_debug=yes" in the command line, and rightclicking on the hero (for my convenience, as
well as yours if you want to quickly check out future new features for
the farther depths (as having to replay many depths just to see a
few new additions is generally overkill))
-fixed the dark adept/spider queen sound bugs.

Demo 3 Changelog:
-added a spider queen boss
-added some upgrades: three new ones, and second tiers for of both
armor/energy upgrades (now there's slowly becoming a tech tree)
-severely nerfed Hoplite's AMLA (as it isn't intended to be a core feature)
-some bugfixes (including: fixing the bug of hoplite hp being reset to full
after attack once he gets an AMLA, and knockback dealing wall
impact damage when it's not supposed to)
-now the the dungeon-like depths are semi-random (randomly
selected from a few preset maps)
-added orcish warrior, a stronger version of orc grunt (they both have the
same damage, but the warrior has higher health, meaning he's risky
to tackle head-on)
-now the enemies' abilities are better described (using [dummy] abilities/specials)

Demo 2 Changelog:
-added a three new enemy types to spice things up a bit
-added an upgrade system (with "forges" appearing every 3 depths. The
upgrade selection is currently rather limited, with no tech trees.)
-now the hoplite moves to the hole after all enemies are killed (and as
long as there are no unused forges)
