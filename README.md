# Spartan
Play as a hoplite in this replayable roguelike campaign, on a quest to retrieve a powerful artifact from the dungeon depths. Features of the campaign include, but are not limited to:

- many gameplay mechanics have been added, changed or removed, resulting in an experience wildly different from what traditional campaigns have to offer. (It's almost a different game, to some extent.)
- procedurally generated levels and unique boss fights
- an upgrade system with many unique combinations and playstyles
- an achievement system with achievements carrying over between playthroughs, as well as an option to start from certain depths you passed in previous playthroughs
- ability to play alone or with a friend in a co-op multiplayer mode! (the second option is available as MP scenario)

Note: Due to all the differences from mainline, there is a built-in documentation about the game, accessible via the 'information menu' rightclick option from any hex.
