They can be killed with one hit of your spear, and only attack if you've standed next to them on the previous turn. Overall, they're easy to kill, but can quickly deal some serious damage should you let your guard down next to a group of them."

You could, however, throw a spear at them and finish them off with a shortsword to not suffer the seemingly guaranteed 5 damage hit.
