-all units (both the player and the enemies) have <span color='#ffff99'>0% defense</span> everywhere, and units are unable to retaliate unless they have the <span color='#ffff99'>counterattack</span> weapon special
-your <span color='#ffff99'>turn ends</span> automatically when you <span color='#ffff99'>attack</span>, or <span color='#ffff99'>move</span> to a tile that doesn't have enemies next to it (unless you have the <span color='#ffff99'>Footwork</span> upgrade).
-In order to progress, move to the hex 6,2 (marked by a <span color='#ffff99'>trapdoor</span>). You will then move to the next depth.
-there is <span color='#ffff99'>no rest healing</span> (unless you have the <span color='#ffff99'>Rest II</span> upgrade), but you recover a third of your max hitpoints worth of health upon descending a depth
-the depths are semi-randomized, with a random map/enemy list. However, depth 1 is always a cave map with orc grunts.
-enemies have <span color='#ffff99'>long-ranged/short-ranged</span> attacks (explained more in the <span color='#ffff99'>Combat</span> section of the guide)
-each depth, there are upgrade <span color='#ffff99'>forges</span> on the map. (explained more in the <span color='#ffff99'>Forges/Upgrades</span> section of the guide). However they become rarer in the later depths
-depths are generated while you move onto the exit, and not in advance, meaning that it's possible to save-scum to get a different map/enemy generation for a given depth (with boss depths being an exception)
-every now and then, you may encounter various objects on the map, like signposts, tombstones, etc. that display text when moved onto. Most of them don't affect gameplay, and exist solely to add lore."

-On the other hand, enemies with the <span color='#ffff99'>short-ranged</span> weapon special (like orcish grunts) can only attack you if you've been next to them on the previous turn, making them relatively easy targets.
-enemies are unable to attack when <span color='#ffff99'>slowed</span>, but you still can.
 -being slowed while you have no enemies next to you ends your turn
-You have a <span color='#ffff99'>killstreak<span> stat shown in the top of the interface. Your killstreak increases by 1 each time you kill an enemy (ally kills don't count), but your killstreak resets if you don't kill an enemy or hit a boss on your turn.
-some enemies are able to <span color='#ffff99'>summon</span> other enemies at regular intervals (like demiliches).
-enemies have increased hitpoints in <span color='#ffff99'>multiplayer</span> (5 extra hitpoints for normal enemies, and a 66% hitpoint increase (as well as a 33% damage increase) for bosses)
-poison deals 4 damage per turn instead of 8"
