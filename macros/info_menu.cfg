-all units (both the player and the enemies) have 0% defense everywhere, and are unable to retaliate
-In order to progress, move to the hex 6,2 (marked by a trapdoor). You will then move to the next depth.
-there is no rest healing (unless you have the 'Rest II' upgrade), but you recover a third of your max hitpoints worth of health upon descending a depth
-the depths are semi-randomized, with a random map/enemy list. However, depth 1 is always a cave map with orc grunts.
-enemies have long-ranged/short-ranged attacks (explained more in the 'Combat' section of the guide)
-each depth, there are upgrade forges on the map. (explained more in the 'Forges/Upgrades' section of the guide). However they become rarer in the later depths
-dungeons are generated while you move onto the exit, and not in advance, meaning that it's possible to save-scum to get a different map/enemy generation for a given depth (with boss depths being an exception)
-every now and then, you may encounter various objects on the map, like signposts, tombstones, etc. that display text when moved onto. Most of them don't affect gameplay, and exist solely to add lore."

-While the shield bash does next to no damage, it can knock back enemies and slow them, effectively rending them immobile for a turn. You can also kill some enemies by bashing them into lava, and harm most by 5 damage when bashing into a wall.
-certain enemies, like archers, are able to attack from afar in a line. Their attacks have a 1-turn charge time, and their targeted hexes are highlighted yellow red or blue if there is a unit they can attack.
-On the other hand, enemies with the short-ranged weapon special (like orcish grunts) can only attack you if you've been next to them on the previous turn, making them relatively easy targets.
-enemies are unable to attack when slowed.
-some enemies are able to spawn other enemies at regular intervals (like demiliches).
-enemies have increased hitpoints in multiplayer (5 extra hitpoints for normal enemies, and a 66% hitpoint increase (as well as a 33% damage increase) for bosses)"

It allows him to move 2 hexes (3 if you have the Teleport II upgrade) for a turn, as well as to jump over enemies/unwalkable terrain, but costs 50 energy. You start with full energy each time you enter a depth (the default is 100, but can be increased by energy upgrades). You also gain energy when killing enemies, equal to the target's level times 10 (5 energy for lvl0 enemies.) by default. Units killed by allies also give energy, but only half as much as normal (in multiplayer, both players get it though). When hitting bosses you also gain energy equal to their level times 5. You gain an extra 50 maximum energy after retrieving the Prometheus' Fire artifact."

The spear can be then picked up by moving to the hex you throw it to (and is picked up automatically when proceeding to the next depth), but until then, you won't be able to use your melee spear attack, leaving you quite vulnerable. This downside can be removed for the first throw on each depth if you take the 'Harpoon' upgrade (and the second too, if you have Harpoon II)."
